42 Piscine — Collaborative Repository

This repository contains complete solutions, notes and utilities for the
42 Piscine.
It exists so we can learn together, cross-review code, finish missing
exercises, and keep everything organized in one place.

It is not part of the Cursus and doesn’t include any Cursus projects.

Important

-   Private repo. Do not share outside the group.
-   This is not a cheat-sheet for people currently doing the Piscine.
-   If you copy/paste code, make sure you actually understand it.
-   Keep subjects and personal data out of public places.

Repository Structure

Each directory matches one Piscine project:

ex00/ ex01/ ex02/ … rush00/ rush01/ shell00/ shell01/ c00/ c01/ … c13/

Inside each project:

/subject.pdf → if available
/notes/ → explanations, edge cases, debugging
/solutions/ → final working code
/tests/ → small manual tests or scripts

Collaboration Workflow

1.  Branches
    -   Create a new branch for any fix or new solution.
    -   Use short, clear names: feat/c05-ex03, fix/c02-split, etc.
2.  Commits Straightforward messages:
    -   fix: handle negative numbers in ft_recursive_power
    -   feat: add solution for c07/ex01
    -   docs: update notes for c08
3.  Pull Requests
    -   Explain what was added or fixed.
    -   Mention remaining TODOs.
    -   Another member approves before merging.
4.  Issues
    -   Track bugs, missing exercises, improvements.
    -   Use tags: bug, todo, enhancement, question.

Development Guidelines

-   Follow Norminette rules.
-   No extra libraries.
-   Add simple tests when useful.
-   Keep comments minimal.
-   ASCII separators welcome.

Resources

-   Norminette
-   Man pages
-   Shell manuals
-   42 official subjects
-   cc, valgrind, lldb/gdb, online C testers
